# Work Day Scheduler

Author: Alexia Fast

## Description

This challenge was to create a calendar where the user can save their input for each hour of the work day, wether that be in the past, present or future. This application is powered by jQuery. One ofthe most interesting parts of this project for me was Local Storage. It was great to see that even if I refreshed the page, what I wrote in my calender would still be present to view. I did find jQuery to be a little confusing as the syntax is similar to JavaScript, however I did get the hang of it.
